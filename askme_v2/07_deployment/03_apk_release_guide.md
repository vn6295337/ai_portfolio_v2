   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. Login to Expo:
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```
   (Use your Expo account credentials)

3. Configure EAS for Android build:
   ```bash
   cd askme-app
   eas build --platform android --type apk
   ```

#### Build Steps:

   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --type apk
   ```

2. When prompted, choose:
   - Platform: **Android**
   - Build type: **APK** (not App Bundle)
   - Flavor: **release**

3. Wait 5-10 minutes for build to complete

4. Download signed APK from EAS Build dashboard

#### Expected Output:
```
✅ Build #1 complete
APK URL: https://...apk
Size: ~45-50 MB
Status: Ready for download
```

### Option B: Local Build (Advanced)

If EAS is unavailable:

## Section 4.5: Distribution - GitHub Release

### Prerequisites:
- GitHub CLI installed: `gh --version`
- Authenticated: `gh auth login`

   # AskMe v1.0.0 - MVP Release

   ## Features
   - Query multiple LLM providers (Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter)
   - Intelligent query routing by category (News, Creative, General)

   ## Architecture
   - Backend: Node.js + Express on Render

   ## Privacy
   - Queries stored locally only
   - No cloud sync or tracking

   - All computation on LLM backends

   ## Known Limitations (MVP)
   - Android only (iOS coming later)
