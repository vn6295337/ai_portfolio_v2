## Test Scenario 13: Failover Behavior (Provider Failure)

**Objective**: Verify secondary/tertiary providers used on primary failure

**Note**: This requires manually testing or using network proxy to simulate provider failure. For MVP, we trust backend failover logic.

### Steps
1. Review backend logs at https://dashboard.render.com
2. Verify failover chain in logs for failed primary requests
3. Or: Use Charles Proxy to block primary provider

### Expected Results

### Expected Results
- [ ] Input field disabled while loading
- [ ] Send button disabled while loading (opacity reduced)
- [ ] Spinner visible in send button
- [ ] Back button/navigation still functional
- [ ] Can dismiss keyboard

### Status
- **Pass** ✅ / **Fail** ❌ / **Blocked** ⏸️
