   - "What is IoT?"
   - "What is 5G?"
   - "What is cloud computing?"
   - "What is cybersecurity?"
   - "What is data science?"

5. Observe response display updates

### Expected Results
- [ ] App handles rapid taps without crashing
- [ ] "Cached response" badge shows consistently
- [ ] Responses display instantly (all cache hits)

2. Queue 5 different queries:
   - "Query 1"
   - "Query 2"
   - "Query 3"
   - "Query 4"
   - "Query 5"
3. Send each query in rapid succession
4. Allow database to record all queries
5. Observe queue storage

### Expected Results
- [ ] All 5 queries queue successfully
- [ ] Each shows "Will sync when online" badge
- [ ] No crashes during queueing
- [ ] Database stores all 5 queries
- [ ] Queue counter (in logs) shows 5 pending

### Status
- **Pass** ✅ / **Fail** ❌ / **Blocked** ⏸️

Notes: _____________________________________________________________________

## Stress Test 4: Offline→Online Sync Load

**Objective**: Sync handles large queue without failure

### Steps
1. **Remain in offline mode** with 5 queued queries
2. **Enable network** (turn off airplane mode)
3. Monitor sync process
4. Allow up to 60 seconds for all queries to sync
5. Observe responses appearing

### Expected Results
- [ ] Sync initiates when network detected
- [ ] All 5 responses eventually arrive
- [ ] Response order may differ from queue order
- [ ] No app crash during sync
- [ ] Database updates with synced responses
- [ ] "Will sync when online" badges removed
- [ ] No duplicate responses

### Sync Timeline (Expected)
- First response: 3-5 seconds
- Remaining responses: Within 30 seconds
- All responses: Within 60 seconds

### Status
- **Pass** ✅ / **Fail** ❌ / **Blocked** ⏸️

## Stress Test 5: Rate Limiting Enforcement

**Objective**: Backend rate limits respected, failover works under load

### Steps
1. Ensure online
2. Send 20 rapid queries in quick succession
3. Monitor error responses
4. Wait 2 minutes
5. Send 5 more queries

### Expected Results
- [ ] First 10-15 queries succeed (within rate limits)
- [ ] Subsequent queries may get "Rate limited" error
- [ ] Error message: "Rate limited. All providers are busy..."
- [ ] Failover between providers evident in logs
- [ ] After 1-2 minute wait: New queries succeed again
- [ ] No app crash due to rate limiting
- [ ] Graceful error handling shown to user

### Rate Limit Thresholds (Backend)
- Gemini: 60 req/min
- Groq: 30 req/min
- OpenRouter: Varies

### Status
- **Pass** ✅ / **Fail** ❌ / **Blocked** ⏸️

Notes: _____________________________________________________________________

## Stress Test 6: Cache Size Limits (50MB)

**Objective**: Cache respects 50MB size limit

### Steps
1. Ensure online
2. Send 50 different queries to build up cache
3. Each query: Different topic (e.g., "Topic 1", "Topic 2", etc.)
4. Monitor cache size growth
5. Query cache table to see entry count

### Expected Results
- [ ] Cache stores 50+ entries without crashing
- [ ] Cache respects 50MB limit (older entries deleted)
- [ ] App performance remains responsive
- [ ] New queries still cache normally
- [ ] No memory leak

### Cache Management
- Oldest entries deleted when limit exceeded
- Cache checked before API call
- Size calculated from response TEXT field

### Status
- **Pass** ✅ / **Fail** ❌ / **Blocked** ⏸️
