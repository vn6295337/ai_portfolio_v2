**AI Transformation Portfolio - Project Summary and Planning**

**User Goal:** Prepare a unified GitHub portfolio using three technical projects to position as an AI Transformation Strategist for job readiness.

**Selected Projects:**
1. **askme** - A CLI tool allowing users to query multiple LLM providers (Google Gemini, Mistral AI, Llama). It emphasizes privacy and zero configuration by routing requests through a backend proxy.
2. **ai-models-discoverer_v3** - A production-grade data pipeline that discovers, enriches, and standardizes metadata for LLMs from APIs like OpenRouter, Google AI, and Groq. Feeds metadata to Supabase for downstream visualization.
3. **ai-land** - A React-based frontend dashboard that visualizes LLM metadata processed by `ai-models-discoverer_v3`. Features interactive model filtering, visualization, and provider/task-based breakdowns.

**Objective:**
Use these three projects to demonstrate applied ML architecture skills, cross-functional system integration, and AI solution strategy capability.

**Portfolio Positioning Strategy:**
- Role Target: **AI Transformation Strategist**
- Outcome Narrative: From raw model discovery to dashboard and CLI-driven querying, the projects together show how AI systems can be conceived, deployed, and made usable by business and technical stakeholders.
- Core Themes: Agentic AI systems, applied MLOps, secure LLM access, process-aware AI architecture.

**Clarifications & Constraints:**
- No current user base or production deployment yet.
- GitHub public presence confirmed. Will need README and structure improvement.
- Targeting recruiter and hiring manager visibility for roles that respect both technical depth and enterprise-scale problem-solving experience.

**Approach Chosen:**
Build toward a recruiter-ready public GitHub portfolio page that links the three projects, unifies their messaging, and provides clear technical and business framing for each.

**Next Steps:**
- A detailed 4-phase checklist (delivered separately) covers tasks including repo audits, documentation, visual assets, storytelling, cross-linking, and launch.
- Each task is atomic and sequential to enable independent progress tracking and short-cycle iteration.

**Status:**
askme-main.zip, ai-models-discoverer_v3-main.zip, and ai-land-main.zip have been received and analyzed.
Portfolio README and integration-level structure now being developed.
